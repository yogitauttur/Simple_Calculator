          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 – 27 July
            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
            In 2002, Abdul Kalam was elected the 11th President of India. He had 
            won by a huge margin. He was the first scientist to become India’s
            President and incidentally the first bachelor too. Kalam’s term 
            as the president which lasted the full term till 2007 was beneficial
             for the office of the president itself. He came to be called the
              People’s President. His popularity soared among the people, especially school children. He visited many parts of the country and his speeches became popular for their motivational content.
Despite pressure from the people to have him stand for a second term, he decided not to contest.
After the presidency, Kalam became a visiting professor at the IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Shillong, IIM Indore, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Anna University, etc.
Abdul Kalam died of a cardiac arrest while giving a lecture at the IIM Shillong on 27 July 2015. There was widespread grief expressed at his passing away with the government of India declaring a 7-day state mourning. The governments of various other countries as well as the United Nations expressed their grief.
He was laid to rest with full state honours at his native Rameswaram.
Abdul Kalam was a man of integrity who was known for his honesty. He left no personal wealth after his death barring a few personal possessions which included his books, laptop, etc.
He was knowledgeable in the teachings of various religions and had become a symbol of inter-faith dialogue.
